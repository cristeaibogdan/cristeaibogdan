<h1 align='center'>👋 Hello!</h1>

Glad to see you here! I'm Bogdan Cristea, a software developer looking to improve my skills in Java and Angular.

## 🚀 Goal

- Learn & grow as a full stack developer by exploring technologies and building projects.

## 🔭 Current Projects
- I'm currently honing my skills with my personal project, `Hephaestus`, an application for issuing recommendations for various household appliances. Check it out at: https://cristeaibogdan.github.io/hephaestus-web/home

⚠️ **The backends are no longer hosted, so the app’s frontend functionality is very limited.**
~The backends were hosted on Azure with a burst configuration, which meant they would shut down automatically when no requests were received.~

## 🌱 Interests
- Software engineering
- Java Programming
- Angular Development
- Solving problems & documenting solutions
